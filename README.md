# Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains examples demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including inheritance and polymorphism.

## Files

- [class.py](class.py):  
  Shows inheritance with a `Smartphone` base class and a specialized `GamingPhone` subclass. Demonstrates methods for calling, texting, charging, and playing games.

- [Polymorphism.py](Polymorphism.py):  
  Demonstrates polymorphism using a `Vehicle` base class and subclasses (`Car`, `Bike`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that override the `move` method.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run each file using the command line:

   ```sh
   python class.py
   python Polymorphism.py
   ```

## Example Output

**Polymorphism.py**
```
The car is driving.
The bike is pedaling.
The plane is flying.
The boat is sailing.
```

**class.py**
